Just left the theater, my mind swirling like a tornado in a popcorn haze. Must’ve forgotten my jacket, the seats were damp. The smell of butter’s still stuck on my hoodie. Borderline — what a name — sounds like a geography lesson, right? But it’s not, don’t let that fool you.

> Where did the whispering lady go? She was always lurking, like that feeling when you leave the house and forget if you locked the door. My back felt like it went through a car accident 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 those chaos scenes, the ones with all the chasing and the flying papers. Reminded me of that annoying pigeon at the park. Distracting yet oddly comforting in its randomness. Wow, who knew shadows could have so much color to them? Insane.

Oh, the theater was 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦zing. I could swear the air con was on Mars 𝘮𝘰𝘥e, straight to ice age.

The warbling music — does warbling even feel right? — anyway, it was like my old radio that works only when it wants to.

Someone dropped their keys, clanging, that sound just as the lead character whispered that cryptic line about “crossing borders within.” My brain tried to knit meaning from echoes and yet I got trapped in thoughts of moths dancing in streetlights on hot summer nights.

Crazy scenes like out of a fever dream — ducks on motorbikes, I swear. Or maybe I just imagined that, who knows, reality’s sketchy at best. Speaking of — remember to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , it's worth the trip through madness.

What was I even trying to recall... guess I’m still processing it all, like an overloaded printer spewing half-printed pages.
